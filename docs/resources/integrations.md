# Integrations

## Test runners/build tools

The Launchable CLI includes pre-built integrations with the following test runners/build tools:

* [Bazel](https://bazel.build/)
* [CTest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#id13)
* [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
* [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
* [Go Test](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest)
* [Nose](https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

And if you aren't using any of those, the CLI also provides a generic "file-based" interface.

See [Recording test results](../training-a-model/recording-test-results.md) and [Subsetting tests](../optimizing-test-execution/subsetting-tests.md#subsetting-tests) for instructions specific to each tool.
